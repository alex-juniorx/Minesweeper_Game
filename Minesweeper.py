#MINESWEEPER GAME
#Game played on terminal on a 9x9 Board, with 16 Bombs, enumerated neighboring positions and final score (based on revealed positions and elapsed time)

import time

#1 INITIAL BOARD IS CREATED:
board = []

for i in range(9):
    board.append(["[ ]"]*9)

#2 FUNCTION USED TO PRINT THE ACTUAL GAME BOARD (WITH NUMBERED ROWS AND COLUMNS):
def print_board(given_board):

    print("     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 ")

    #4.3 Positions are enumerated based on neighboring bombs (except for bomb positions).
